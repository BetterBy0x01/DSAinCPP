Inclusion-Exclusion principle - for programming questions asking for the no. of ways to do something.

/*
    In a class students are given option to either opt for french or german class
    Let n1 students chose french,   
        n2 students chose German,
      & n3 students chose both 
      So, the total number of students in the class = (n1+n2-n3)
        or 
        total no. of ways = (no. of ways to do one thing in a way + 
                             no. of ways to do the thing in another way - 
                             no. of ways to do both things).

The inclusion-exclusion principle shown here works only if two numbers are co-primes. 
So a more general way is to 
    count the nums divisible by a + count the nums divisible by b - count the nums divisible by LCM(a,b).
To get LCM(a,b) , we have the formula lcm(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b)
